                The name dachshund is of German origin and literally means "badger dog," from Dachs ("badger") and Hund ("hound, dog"). The German word is pronounced [ˈdaks.hʊnt] (listen). The pronunciation varies in English: variations of the first and second syllables include /ˈdɑːks-/, /ˈdæks-/ and /-hʊnt/, /-hʊnd/, /-ənd/. It may be pronounced as /ˈdæʃ-/hound by some English speakers.[7][8] Although Dachshund is a German word, in modern German they are more commonly known by the short name Dackel or Teckel.[9]

Because of their long, narrow build, they are often nicknamed wiener dog[10] or sausage dog.

                    Classification
                </h3>
                <p>
                    While classified in the hound group or scent hound group in the United States and Great Britain, the breed has its own group in the countries which belong to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (World Canine Federation).[11] Many dachshunds, especially the wire-haired subtype, may exhibit behavior and appearance that are similar to that of the terrier group of dogs.[12] An argument can be made for the scent (or hound) group classification because the breed was developed to use scent to trail and hunt animals, and probably descended from the Saint Hubert Hound like many modern scent hound breeds such as bloodhounds and Basset Hounds; but with the persistent personality and love for digging that probably developed from the terrier, it can also be argued that they could belong in the terrier, or "earth dog", group

            Characteristics
        </h2>
        <p>
            A typical dachshund is long-bodied and muscular with short stubby legs. Its front paws are disproportionately large, being paddle-shaped and particularly suitable for digging. Its skin is loose enough not to tear while tunneling in tight burrows to chase prey. The dachshund has a deep chest which provides plenty of space for heart development and lung capacity. Its snout is long.

            Characteristics
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are three dachshund coat varieties: smooth coat (short hair), long-haired, and wire-haired.[14] Longhaired dachshunds have a silky coat and short featherings on legs and ears. Wire-haired dachshunds are the least common coat variety in the United States (although it is the most common in Germany) and the most recent coat to appear in breeding standards.
